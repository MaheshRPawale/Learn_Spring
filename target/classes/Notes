  
  
    if we want to manually retrieve a bean (object) from the ApplicationContext, there are a few common ways to achieve this
  
    1) Using BeanFactory (less common with annotations)
    
    BeanFactory factory = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
    MyBean myBean = factory.getBean(MyBean.class);
    
    2)Using ApplicationContext.getBean()
    // By Bean Name
   MyBean myBean1 = (MyBean) context.getBean("myBean");
   
   3) Using a Custom Bean Utility Class
